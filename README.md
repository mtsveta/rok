Rok is a project for the reactive transport simulations in two-dimensional porous media with heterogeneous geologic properties. 
It couples Reaktoro, computational framework developed in C++ and Python that implements numerical methods for modeling 
chemically reactive processes governed by either chemical equilibrium, chemical kinetics, or a combination of both, and 
Firedrake, an open-source library for solving partial differential equations with finite element methods. The latter one 
is used to solve the equations that govern transport processes (advection/diffusion equations) and fluid flow (i.e., Darcy 
equation).
